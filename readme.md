# Install Laravel 5.5 - Bootstrap 4 - Jquery 3.3 - Fontawesome 4.7

The purpose of this very simple repository is to create, quickly, a running laravel framework with Bootstrap 4, Jquery 3.3 and fontawesome.

**Javascript: the easy way.**

What do I mean?
I mean not taking advantage of the ES2015 syntax with modules.
I just want to us javascript the classic way: concatenate the js files in good order and than minify them for production.
Laravel-mix can do it for us very easily.
So, I concatenate, in this order:
1. Jquery
2. Bootstrap javascripts files. Just the ones I need, to get a smaller .js file.
3. Any other javascript library like select2, daterangepicker and so on.
4. My own javascript scripts.

**Requirements:**

* Linux OS (I use Ubuntu 16.04)
 *Porting to Windows or Mac should be very easy.*
* PHP ~7.0 and composer
*Laravel 5.5 requires PHP 7.0.0 or higher.*
* Node.js and npm

**Installation instructions**

1. Download the repository
2. Run ```./install.sh```
3. In the file ```webpack.mix.js``` uncoment the files that you want to load for your javascript to work.
